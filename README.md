## Description

OPTIGA™ TPM (Trusted Platform Module) offers a broad portfolio of standardized security controllers to protect the integrity and authenticity of embedded devices and systems. With a secured key store and support for a variety of encryption algorithms, OPTIGA™ TPM security chips provide robust protection for critical data and processes through their rich functionality.

OPTIGA™ TPM security controllers are ideal for platforms running both Windows and Linux and its derivatives (SLB 9645 product versions for Chrome OS available). Based on Trusted Computing Group (TCG) standards, they support the TPM 1.2 or the latest innovative TPM 2.0 standard.
